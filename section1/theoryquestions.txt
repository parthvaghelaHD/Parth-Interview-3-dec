1. **Explain the following concepts in Node.js:**
- Event Loop
    - event loop is basically one type of loop that we can say that is continously checking the callstack and the microtask queue and 
    callback queue.
    - so when process come into the callstack that will be execute once callstack will be empty then eventloop checks the microtask 
    queue if there is any pending task then it will put into the callstack and once callstack and microtask queue will be empty then
    it will check if there is any callback queue tasks pemnding then it will put it it to the call stack  
    so thats how the whole event loop concepts works.

- Asynchronous Programming
    asynchronous programming allows us to handle or run the taks without blocking the main thread. to achieve the asynchronous
    programing we have concepts of callback promises, and the async await that enables the handle the tasks without blocking the main thread. or we can say on single thread

- Middleware
    - middleware is basically one type of common function that helps uase in the every route to validafte the logic iwhether it is corrrect or not 
    so some jwtauthentication middlwqarees and joi middleware so that all the helps to add one additional check so that is all about the middlwqaRE



2. **Discuss the importance of connection pooling in database interactions. How does
it improve performance?**
   -  connection pooling reuses a set of the database connections to hande the muultiple requests efficiancy. It Reduces the overhead of creating and callclosing connections 
   repeatetly improving performance and scalability.



3. **What are the advantages of using prepared statements in MSSQL?**
 - it enhance the secuity by preventing the SQL Injections. also improve theperformance by reusing compiled query plans. they also simplyfy the 
 parameterized query handling.


4. **Describe the process of sending an email using Node.js. What packages are
commonly used for this purpose?**
    - for sending an emails we need to configure the gmail credentials with nodemailer 
    - required nodemailer package
    - so with the help of credentials using the smtp connection on the secure port number we can pass the username and password of 
    the gmail id from where i am sending so its like senders credentials i nees to setup and the recevers information like email body,
    subject and the email id of the receiver i need to pass so it helps in such a use cases like after registration email notification
    subscription remainder notifications etc...
